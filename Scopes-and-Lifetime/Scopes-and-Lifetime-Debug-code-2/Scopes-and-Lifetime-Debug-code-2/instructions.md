# Instructions
1. Debug the code `main.py`.
2. `function_b()` should ask the user for their name and greet the user.
3. `print()` is unable to access the user's input, fix the code so that the program can greet the user.
4. Once you are done, raise your hand for your teacher to check! :)

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input
```plaintext
Bob
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
Hello, Bob
```
_**Explanation:** The program recieves the name `Bob` and greets the user accordingly._

## Hint
1. There are 2 ways to access the name variable. First method, we can access `name` if we do it locally. Second method, we can access `name` if it is a global variable.
2. Ensure that you only access the `name` after it is created otherwise it will not exist. 

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the given inputs.
