# Instructions
1. In your `main.py` file, use the `import` keyword to import the constants and functions from `import_me.py` file.
2. Call `mystery_function1` and `mystery_function2` in `main.py` file.
3. Pass in the `password` variable into `mystery_function2`.
4. Observe the output to ensure that the functions have been called correctly and are providing the correct output.

## Example
### Correct Output
```plaintext
You have called a function from another file!
The password is "I am a Young Maker!"
```

## Hint
1. Use the `import` keyword followed by the name of the file (without the `.py` extension) to import contents of another Python file.
2. Once imported, you can call any function from that file using the syntax `<filename>.<function_name>()`.

## Test Your Code
