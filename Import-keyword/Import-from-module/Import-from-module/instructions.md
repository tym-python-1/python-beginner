# Instructions
1. Write a program that uses the `math` module to perform a mathematical operation.
2. The program should take a single number as input from the user.
3. The program should output the value of this number multiplied by the `pi` constant from the `math` module.

## Example Input and Output
### Example 1
#### Example Input
```plaintext
2
```
#### Example Output
```plaintext
6.283185307179586
```

## Hint
1. Use the `import` keyword to import the `math` module.
2. Utilize `math.pi` to get the value of pi.
3. Multiply the input number by the value of pi and print the result.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the input.

## Final Note
- Before submitting, make sure that your program correctly multiplies the input number by the value of pi from the `math` module and produces the correct output.
