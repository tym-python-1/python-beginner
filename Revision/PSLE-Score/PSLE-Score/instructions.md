# Instructions
1. Write a program in `main.py` that takes 1 integer as input from the user.
2. The program should then tell us the PSLE Achivement Level(AL) score based on the marks provided.

| AL | Marks  |
|---|---|
| 1  | 90-100 |
| 2  | 85-89  |
| 3  | 80-84  |
| 4  | 75-79  |
| 5  | 65-74  |
| 6  | 45-64  |
| 7  | 20-44  |
| 8  | 0-19   |

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
85
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
2
```
_**Explanation:** The program took in 85 and prints AL of 2._

## Hint
1. Use the `input()` function to take one integer input from the user.
2. Convert the inputs to integers before performing the comparison.
3. Recall comparison operators `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==` and `!=`.
4. Use a conditional statement (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to compare the two numbers and determine the largest one.
5. Print the corresponding Achivement Level.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the given inputs.

### Test Results
- If your code passes all the tests, you will see the following screen.

- If any test case fails, analyze the `Results` section to identify the error and refine your code.

## Final Note
- Before submitting, ensure that your program correctly prints the Achivement Level based on the student's marks.
