# Instructions
1. Write a program in `main.py` that prompts the user to input their name as a string.
2. The program should then output a greeting, in the format `Hello, <name>!`.
   - There should be no space between the name and the exclamation mark.
   - Use the `+` operator to concatenate the strings if needed.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
Harry
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
Hello, Harry!
```

_**Explanation:** The program takes "Harry" as input and prints out the greeting in the specified format._

## Hint
1. Read the user's name using the `input()` function.
2. Concatenate the strings properly to ensure the output is in the correct format.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and provide different names as input, then check if it provides the correct greeting based on the input.
