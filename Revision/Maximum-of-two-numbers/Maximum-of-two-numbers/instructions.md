# Instructions
1. Write a program in `main.py` that takes two integers as input from the user.
2. The program should then compare the two numbers and print the largest among them.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
3
7
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
7
```
_**Explanation:** The program compares 3 and 7 and prints 7 as it is the largest among them._

## Hint
1. Use the `input()` function twice to take two integer inputs from the user.
2. Convert the inputs to integers before performing the comparison.
3. Use a conditional statement (`if`, `else`) to compare the two numbers and determine the largest one.
4. Print the largest number.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the given inputs.

## Final Note
- Before submitting, ensure that your program correctly identifies and prints the largest number between any two given integers.
