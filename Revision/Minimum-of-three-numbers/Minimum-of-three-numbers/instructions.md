# Instructions
1. Write a program in `main.py` that takes three integers as input from the user.
2. The program should then compare the three numbers and print the least among them.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
5
3
7
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
3
```
_**Explanation:** The program compares 5, 3, and 7 and prints 3 as it is the least among them._

## Hint
1. Use the `input()` function three times to take three integer inputs from the user.
2. Convert the inputs to integers before performing the comparison.
3. Use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to compare the three numbers and determine the least one.
4. Print the least number.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the given inputs.

## Final Note
- Before submitting, ensure that your program correctly identifies and prints the least number among any three given integers.
