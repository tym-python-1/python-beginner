# Instructions
1. Develop a program in `main.py` which swaps the values stored in the variables `a` and `b`.
2. Do not alter the code on lines 1-4 and 12-18. Ensure your program can adapt to different inputs, e.g., any value of `a` and `b`.

## Warning
- Your solution should only modify the values of `a` and `b`, and you should not modify any other part of the provided code.
- The output in your program should match the example output shown exactly, character for character, including spaces and symbols.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
a: 3
b: 5
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
a: 5
b: 3
```

## Hint
1. There is no need to hard-code any numbers in your solution.
2. Consider using additional variables to hold interim values during the swap process.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your code, run it to see if it meets the expectations. When you are confident in your solution, submit it for evaluation.
