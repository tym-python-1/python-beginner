# Instructions
1. Write a program in `main.py` that takes two float as input from the user.
2. The program should then calculate the area of a triangle and print the result.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
3
5
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
7.5
```
_**Explanation:** The program took in 3 and 5 and calculated the area of triangle to be 7.5._

## Hint
1. Use the `input()` function twice to take two float inputs from the user.
2. Formula for area of a triangle: 0.5 × base × height.
3. Print the area of triangle.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the given inputs.
