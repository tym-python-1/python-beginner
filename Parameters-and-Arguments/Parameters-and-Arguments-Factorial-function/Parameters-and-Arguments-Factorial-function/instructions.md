# Instructions
1. Write a function named `factorial` in `main.py` that has 1 parameter.
2. The function should return the factorial of the argument.
3. Factorial of a number is the product of all the number from 1 to the specified number. E.g. factorial of 6 is 1×2×3×4×5×6 = 720
4. Factorial of 0 is 1.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Argument #1
```plaintext
factorial(5)
```
#### Example Returned Value #1
```plaintext
120
```
_**Explanation:** The `factorial` function takes in `5` as an argument and returns the factorial result which is `120` = 1×2×3×4×5._

### Example 2
#### Example Argument #2
```plaintext
factorial(0)
```
#### Example Returned Value #2
```plaintext
1
```
_**Explanation:** Note that factorial of 0 is 1._

## Hint
1. The function requires 1 integer parameter.
2. Use `loops` and `range(start, end)` to perform the multiplication.
3. Initialise a variable with value `1` to perform the multiplication within the loop
4. `Return` the factorial of the number.

## Test Your Code
