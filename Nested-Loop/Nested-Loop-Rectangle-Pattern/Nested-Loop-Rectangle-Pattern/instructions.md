# Instructions
1. Write a program in `main.py` that prompts the user to input two integers representing the number of rows and columns, respectively.
2. The program should then output a rectangle made of asterisks (*), with the dimensions corresponding to the inputted number of rows and columns.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
3
5
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
*****
*****
*****
```
_**Explanation:** The user inputs `3` for rows and `5` for columns. The program then prints a rectangle made of asterisks with 3 rows and 5 columns.._

## Hint
1. Use the `input()` function twice to take two integer inputs from the user.
2. Convert the inputs to integers before performing the operation
3. Use nested loops to print the desired rectangle. The outer loop should control the rows, while the inner loop should control the columns.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the given inputs.

## Final Note
- Before submitting, ensure that your program correctly prints a rectangle with the dimensions specified by the user.
