# Instructions
1. Write a program in main.py that prompts the user to input a single integer.
2. The program should then output a multiplication table up to the inputted value.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
3
```
#### Example Output #1
```
1 * 1 = 1
1 * 2 = 2
1 * 3 = 3
2 * 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 3 = 6
3 * 1 = 3
3 * 2 = 6
3 * 3 = 9
```
_**Explanation:** The user inputs "3". The program then prints a multiplication table up to 3._

## Hint
1. Use the input() function to take an integer input from the user.
2. Convert the input to an integer before performing the operation.
3. Use nested loops to print the desired multiplication table.
4. The outer loop should the control multiplication value while the inner loop should control the right multiplication value.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the given inputs.

- If the output is correct, and there are no errors, proceed to submit it.

### Test Results
- If your code passes all the tests, you will see the following screen.

- If any test case fails, analyze the `Results` section to identify the error and refine your code.

## Final Note
- Ensure your program correctly tell the user if the input is too low/high indefinetly until the user finally guesses correctly.
