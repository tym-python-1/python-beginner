# Instructions
1. Write a program in `main.py` that takes five numbers as input from the user, each separated by a new line.
2. Calculate the sum of these five numbers and store it in the variable `result`.
3. Print the value of `result`.

## Constraints
- You are not allowed to use any variables except the `result` variable.
- You are allowed to use the `range()` function in the for loop.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
0
1
2
3
4
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
10
```

## Hint
1. Use a for loop and the `range()` function to take input five times.
2. Convert the input to an integer and add it to the `result` variable in each iteration.
3. After the loop, print the `result` variable.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the given inputs.

### Test Results
- If your code passes all the tests, you will see the following screen.

- If any test case fails, analyze the `Results` section to identify the error and refine your code.

## Final Note
- Before submitting, ensure that your program correctly calculates the sum of the five input numbers using only the `result` variable.
