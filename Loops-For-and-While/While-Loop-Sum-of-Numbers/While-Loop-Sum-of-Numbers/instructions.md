# Instructions
1. Write a program in `main.py` that takes in an indefinite number of  integer.
2. Using a while loop the program will add all the number the user input until the user types `'q'`.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
8
2
3
4
1
q
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
18
```
_**Explanation:** The user inputs `8`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `1` and finally the program stops asking for input after the user types `q` giving us the sum `18`_

## Hint
1. Keep asking user for input and stop when user types `q`.
2. Using a while loop, check if the user typed `q` else add the number to the sum (We can assume user will only type `q` or an integer).
3. You will need to type casting using `int()` and `str()` based on the user input.
4. Print the sum.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the given inputs.

- If the output is correct, and there are no errors, proceed to submit it.

### Test Results
- If your code passes all the tests, you will see the following screen.

- If any test case fails, analyze the `Results` section to identify the error and refine your code.

## Final Note
- Ensure your program correctly prints the total sum of all the numbers.
